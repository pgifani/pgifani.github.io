excerpt: 'COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide. One of the most important hurdles in controlling the spread of this disease is the inefficiency and lack of medical tests. Computed tomography (CT) scans are promising in providing accurate and fast detection of COVID-19. However, determining COVID-19 requires highly trained radiologists and suffers from inter-observer variability. To remedy these limitations, this paper introduces an automatic methodology based on an ensemble of deep transfer learning for the detection of COVID-19.'
