collection: publications
permalink: /publication/pub9
excerpt: 'In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for illustrating the cardiac movements in echocardiogarphic images by utilizing temporal information and sparse representation. For the proposed method, we first derived temporal information by extracting intensity variation time curves (IVTC) assessed for each pixel. Then an over complete dictionary based on prior knowledge of the temporal signals and a set of pre-specified known functions was designed. The IVTCs can then be described as linear combinations of a few prototype atoms in the dictionary. We used the Bayesian Compressive Sensing (BCS) sparse recovery algorithm to find the sparse coefficients of the signals. By decomposing the IVTCs to different families and extracting proper features based on the sparse information, we attain the color coded images which illustrates the general movements of cardiac segments. The database consists of 21 echocardiography sequence of normal and abnormal volunteers in short axes and 4 chamber views. The results show the great achievement in global wall motion estimations.'
