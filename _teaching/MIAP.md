Medical image analysis and processing has great significance in the field of medicine, especially in non-invasive treatment and clinical study.There is a clear need for the accurate interpretation and analysis of medical images, which often involves the need of a computer aided system to understand the image, the image structure and to know what it means.

Learning outcomes:
* Demonstrate subject specific knowledge and understanding in theoretical and practical aspects of Medical Image Analysis and Processing.
* Develop specialised skills and critical understanding of advanced image analysis and processing principles using the Python platform.
* Gain critical insight into challenges underpinning image analysis, including image enhancement and compensating for artefacts.
* Apply specialised skills in image analysis and processing through independent and autonomous activity and communicate outcomes to a range of audiences.
* Critically appraise various deep learning architectures and algorithms used in image segmentation, object detection and classification.
