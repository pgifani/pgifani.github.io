* Course Description:
In this course, the overall structures of microprocessors and microcontrollers will be described. Next, a relative simple but popular microcontroller will be introduced in details. Moreover, some common used microprocessor peripherals will be discussed.
 
* Course Goals and Objectives:
In this course, students will become familiar with the structure of microprocessors and computer systems; also, using a versatile 8-bit microcontroller, they learn how to design, build, and program microprocessor systems equipped with common used peripherals.
 
*Course Topics:
  * General structure of computers, basic definitions of microprocessor and microcontroller
  * Representation of numbers in computer systems, and discussing the algorithms of some common computations over them
  * Introducing the AVR family and some of the capabilities of this group of microcontrollers
  * Structure and types of memory embedded in Atmega32
  * Review of Atmega32 instructions and assembly programming
  * Definition of “interrupt” and its different types in AVR
  * Discussing the structure of timers / counters embedded in Atmega32
  * Programming and working with Atmega32 parallel port, besides introducing their internal structures
  * Programming and working with Atmega32 serial ports, besides introducing their internal structures (USART, TWI, SPI)
  * Employing C programming to develop AVR-based applications (preferably in CodeVision environment)
  * Working with AVR analog comparator
  * Connecting a matrix keyboard to a microcontroller and its reading algorithms
  * Connecting “Text LCD” to a microcontroller, and program it
  * Connecting FTDI (microcontroller to USB interface) to AVR, and program
  * Familiarity with some of the more advanced microcontrollers and an overview of their capabilities (preferably with ARM core)
