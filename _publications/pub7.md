title: "Automatic morphological classification of mitral valve diseases in echocardiographic images based on explainable deep learning methods"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/pub7
excerpt: 'Carpentierâ€™s functional classification is a guide to explain the types of mitral valve regurgitation based on morphological features. There are four types of pathological morphologies, regardless of the presence or absence of mitral regurgitation: Type I, normal; Type II, mitral valve prolapse; Type IIIa, mitral valve stenosis; and Type IIIb, restricted mitral leaflet motion. The aim of this study was to automatically classify mitral valves using echocardiographic images.'
