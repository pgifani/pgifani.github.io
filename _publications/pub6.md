excerpt: 'Quantification of lung involvement in COVID-19 using chest Computed tomography (CT) scan can help physicians to evaluate the progression of the disease or treatment response. This paper presents an automatic deep transfer learning ensemble based on pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the severity of COVID -19 as normal, mild, moderate, and severe based on the images of the lungs CT. In  this  study,  two  different  deep  transfer  learning  strategies  were  used.  In the  first  procedure, features were extracted from fifteen pre-trained CNNs architectures and then fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. In the second procedure, the pre-trained CNNs were fine-tuned using the chest CT images, and then features were extracted for the purpose of classification by the softmax layer. Finally, an ensemble method was developed based on  majority  voting  of  the  deep  learning  outputs  to  increase  the  performance  of  the  recognition  on  each  of  the  two strategies. A dataset of CT scans was collected and then labeled as normal (314), mild (262), moderate (72), and severe (35) for COVID-19 by the consensus of two highly qualified radiologists.  The  ensemble  of  five  deep  transfer  learning  outputs  named  EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetB4,  InceptionV3, NasNetMobile, and ResNext50 in the second strategy has better results than the first strategy and also the individual deep transfer learning models in diagnosing the severity of COVID-19 with 85% accuracy. Our proposed study is well suited for quantifying lung involvement of COVID-19 and can help physicians to monitor the progression of the disease.'
