excerpt: 'In order to identify regional wall motion abnormality in clinical practice, visually assessment of left ventricular mechanical functionality based on echocardiograms is still preferable and dominant. Although experienced cardiologists may perform a visual diagnosis accurately and effortlessly, novice examiners usually have difficulty. In this study, we present a new color-encoded mapping of the overall myocardial motion of the left ventricle in one cardiac cycle to facilitate the identification of abnormal segments for inexperienced examiners. In our method, two-dimensional speckle tracking with a new approach is employed to estimate myocardial tissue displacements. By assigning a color map to the summation of the displacements' magnitude, our proposed color-encoded map is emerged, which represents a relative measure of the overall mechanical activity of the left ventricle. Considering echocardiography-based examinations of two certified cardiologists as the gold standard, a comparison between the accuracy values of two series of assessments based on echocardiogram sequences as well as our proposed color-encoded map, carried out by 19 novices, illustrates an average agreement of 69.15% and 82.60%, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that this color-encoded map can be used as a complementary tool for cardiologists especially the amateurs to perform diagnosis with more accuracy.'
